**Course Instructor:** [Gül İnan](https://gulinan.github.io/)

**Course Summary:**

<p align="justify">

`MAT555E` is graduate level course aims to provide an introduction to mathematical and statistical theory behind the methods commonly used in learning from data in today's modern era. The course is designed such that:    

  - The methods covered will include supervised learning algorithms with a focus on regression and classification problems and unsupervised learning algorithms with a 
  focus on clustering problems.      
  - Extensions of these methods to high-dimensional settings will also be discussed.      
  - Application of these methods to data analysis problems and their implementation 
  will be done via Python.       
 
At the end of the semester, the students are expected:

  - To be fluent in the fundamental principles behind many statistical learning methods,
  - To be able to apply statistical learning methods to real life problems and data sets, and
  - Be prepared for more advanced coursework or scientific research in machine learning and related fields.

Since the course goes deep into the mathematical and statistical theory behind the methods and uses Python for implementation, this course requires the following background:

  - Knowledge of linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimization,
  - Familiarity with Python's Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn libraries, 
  - Familiarity with at least one computational document such as Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Visual Studio Code, or RStudio Quarto, and
  - Familiarity with Git and GitHub commands.
